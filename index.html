            <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">With over 14 years of expertise in graphic design and photography, coupled with more than 7 years of specialized experience in WordPress website design, I am dedicated to crafting captivating and intuitive online platforms tailored to diverse clients and audiences.<br />In my role as a web designer at Chatrenoor, a prominent online commercial platform focusing on outdoor lighting, I am entrusted with the design and maintenance of the website, ensuring seamless functionality, accessibility, and aesthetic appeal. Collaborating closely with the marketing team, I optimize the website for enhanced SEO performance, conversion rates, and user engagement.<br />In my role as the principal website designer of Blho Education School, I am deeply involved in crafting the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) of the platform. Leveraging my expertise in UX/UI design principles, I ensure that our online courses and resources are not only visually appealing but also intuitively navigable and user-friendly, enhancing the overall learning experience for our students.<br />In my vibrant role as both the Festival Coordinator and Graphic Designer at Afdesta International Festival, I've had the privilege of immersing myself in the dynamic world of photography festivals. As the Festival Coordinator, I orchestrate the seamless execution of events, ensuring that every moment is a celebration of global art and culture. Meanwhile, as a Graphic Designer, I infuse my creative vision into every aspect of the festival's branding, from captivating posters to compelling flyers and mesmerizing logos. Through these dual roles, I've had the opportunity to blend my passion for design with my dedication to promoting and preserving the rich heritage of international art and music, creating an unforgettable experience for all attendees.</p>
